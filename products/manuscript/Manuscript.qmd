# Introduction

## General Background Information

Understanding the link between alcohol consumption and TB infection is crucial for public health, as alcohol may influence the immune system and increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. Similar analyses have been conducted in different populations, but this study in Kampala, Uganda, provides valuable insights into a region with unique characteristics and challenges.

## Description of data and data source

The data comes from an going prospective cohort study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, involving 902 adults aged 15 to 65 years without evidence of previous infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The participants were recruited through community tuberculin skin test (TST) surveys and HIV/TB Care Clinics. Data collection included baseline evaluations, quarterly follow-ups for up to 18 months, questionnaires on TB exposure and alcohol consumption, and blood samples for Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) testing.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

What is the association between demographic factors and incidence of latent TB infection?

What is the relationship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of latent TB infection?

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a].

# Methods

## Study Design 

A prospective cohort study of 902 adults from the Kawempe and Rubaga divisions of Kampala, Uganda, without evidence for previous infection with Mtb, to estimate the incidence of Mtb infection. Eligible residents who are between the ages of 15 and 65 years were enrolled following informed consent. Study participants were evaluated at baseline then followed quarterly for up to 18 months. During the quarterly visits, participants completed questionnaires regarding exposure to TB, alcohol consumption, and gave a blood sample for Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) testing.

## Study Population and Setting 

The study was conducted in the Kawempe and Rubaga Divisions of Kampala, and contiguous parishes. The total population of Rubaga is approximately 383,216 people based on a 2014 census. Kawempe is adjacent to Rubaga. It comprises 19 parishes and 740 villages that are political units headed by a Local Council

## Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

### Inclusion 

No evidence of Mtb infection TST \< 5 mm QFT negative Asymptomatic for symptoms of active TB

### Exclusion

Children, residents \< 15 years Active or subclinical TB Previously treated for TB Previously treated for LTBI and Immunosuppresive medication

**Recruitment, Screening, and Enrollment** 
The study participants were be recruited through community TST surveys and HIV/TB Care
Clinics in the catchment area. The enrollment into the study involved a 2-step process of screening
then enrollment (Figure 1). A separate consent form was signed for each step in this process. After
signing an informed consent for screening, prospective participant completed a short questionnaire to determine exclusionary criteria. Those that met any exclusionary criteria were referred to the
local health care system, whereas the remaining individuals proceeded with screening. Among
those not excluded, a baseline blood sample was taken for testing with an IGRA. Only after taking
the blood sample, a TST was placed and read by the field team between 48 and 72 hours later.
Those screened with a TST \< 5 mm continued in the study, whereas those with TST â‰¥ 5 mm were
referred to the local health care system for further TB risk evaluation and TB preventive therapy
(TPT) as indicated. Participants with a TST \< 5 mm and negative IGRA met all study criteria
continued in the study (Figure 1) for the duration of follow-up.
Follow-up evaluations were performed quarterly up to 18 months. During these visits, field
workers measured current exposure risk to M. tuberculosis, signs and symptoms of active TB
disease. At each visit, blood samples was taken at each visit for immunologic analysis.
Questionnaires were used to collect relevant data on demographics, health status, and overall
experiences. Questionnaires were completed in-person or via phone.

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender. We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("products","assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```

## Data aquisition

*As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next.*

## Data import and cleaning

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

## Statistical analysis

*Explain anything related to your statistical analyses.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

we used histograms, bar graphs, and box plots, to show how data was distributed.We did cross tabulation between the covariates and the outcome to the proportionss of each.


```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
#knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
#resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
#knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

*Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means.*

## Strengths and Limitations

*Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis.*

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
